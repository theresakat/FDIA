# FDIA (2018 Framework Data Inventory and Assessment)
This repository contains the survey data returned from the 2018 FDIA, the R scripts used to load, clean, and analyze the survey data, and hopefully will also contain the R markdown for reporting the results. 

"Initial data plug" contains data exported from the survey on April 20, 2018.
