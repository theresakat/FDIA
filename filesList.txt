SCRIPTS

1_Load_FDIA.R       Loads R libraries

2_importData.R      Imports data: raw export of Survey Monkey
                    data; Scoring codes; Framework Master table (from FW
                    database)
                
3.0_clean_SurveyData.R  Clean/add IDs/correct spellings, etc.

2.1_findErrors.R    Use to to find and confirm errors in the raw data, e.g., 
			              - missing numeric IDs (NAs)
			              - duplicated ID values
			              - duplicated data element values
		    	          - outputs are used in 

3.1_clean-02-UniteSurveyData.R    Unite responses for single questions that span
		                multiple columns in raw Survey Monkey data
                    
4_EDA.R             Uses results from maturityInd.R to create some simple 
                    graphs of the maturity index.
                
maturityInd.R       Calculate the maturity index.

scoresheet.R        Generate element counts by theme.

tidying.R	    Use to convert cleaned and united data to a tidy data format; 
		    calculate theme maturity index; draft work to calcuate data life cycle
		    stage maturity index
                    

FDIAfunctions.R     collection of functions to import factors, calculate the mode, and draw 
		    gauge graphs. Future enhancement: create a single function that can use 
                    conditions to apply the correct import procedure/func.

yesno.R             Unite yes/no question columns in in raw Survey Monkey data

mydata-clean-20181127.csv   dataset export from R. Data source in R: mydata
                    Purpose: data were exported to allow import to Excel for

                    -clean-20181127.csv
                    Purpose: data were exported to use Excel for quick sorting
                    of the results. 
                    
matSort             dataset. Results of the maturityInd.R script. Individual
		                data elements only.

scoring		          table. Imported Scoring.XLSX containing attributes for all survey
		                variables, including:

		    to match responses with themes

longVals	    dataset. Contains cleaned and united (known errors corrected) survey 
		    data. Data can be used to calculate maturity indices. Additional LUTS
